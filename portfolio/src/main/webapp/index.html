      <p>Hi! My name is Mark Gacoka. I am a sophomore at Minerva Schools at KGI which is based in San Francisco, CA. I am also a CS major minoring in Business and planning to concentrate in Data Science.</p>
      <p>I was born in a fast paced city called Nairobi in Kenya where there is a lot of wildlife and beautiful scenaries but also functions as a tech hub. My hobbies include swimming and playing chess online against robots (the singularity has entered the chat :)</p>
      <p>One thing that makes me unique is my love for learning and my curiosity to discover things most people don't think of uncovering i.e. the meaning of life, emerging topics in the physical sciences and paradoxes.</p>
